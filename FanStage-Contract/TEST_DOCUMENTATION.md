## Key Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Campaign Lifecycle
```typescript
1. Artist registers via ArtistIdentity
2. Artist creates campaign via CampaignRegistry
3. Funders contribute IDRX
4. Funders receive Artist Tokens (ERC-20) + Tier Badges (ERC-1155)
5. Campaign reaches target â†’ Status changes to FUNDED
6. Artist submits revenue
7. Profit distributed based on tier weights
8. Funders claim their share
9. Status changes to COMPLETED
```

### Scenario 2: Refund During Campaign
```typescript
1. Funder contributes 10,000 IDRX â†’ Gets Gold badge
2. Campaign status: ONGOING
3. Funder needs money â†’ Calls refund()
4. Artist Tokens burned
5. Gold badge NFT burned
6. 10,000 IDRX returned
7. totalRaised decreases
```

### Scenario 3: Tier-Based Profit Distribution
```typescript
Revenue: 100,000 IDRX
Funder Share: 30% = 30,000 IDRX pool

Alice: 10,000 IDRX, Gold (3%) â†’ weighted 30,000
Bob: 10,000 IDRX, Bronze (1%) â†’ weighted 10,000
Total weighted: 40,000

Alice gets: 30,000 Ã— (30,000/40,000) = 22,500 IDRX (225% ROI!)
Bob gets: 30,000 Ã— (10,000/40,000) = 7,500 IDRX (75% ROI)

Result: Same funding amount, but Gold tier gets 3x more profit!
```

## Important Test Cases

###  Critical: Profit Distribution Math
```typescript
// Test ensures weighted distribution is correct
Weighted Share = fundedAmount Ã— tierProfitPercent
Funder Share = funderPool Ã— (weighted / totalWeighted)

This formula ensures:
- Higher tiers get proportionally more profit
- Pro-rata based on funding amount
- No rounding errors
```

### ðŸ”’ Critical: Refund Security
```typescript
// Prevents refund after revenue distributed
if (status == COMPLETED) revert RefundNotAvailable();

// Burns all tier badges on refund
for (each tier badge) {
  _burn(badge);
}

// Updates campaign totalRaised
campaignData.totalRaised -= tokenBalance;
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical: Tier Badge Minting
```typescript
// Automatically mints badges when thresholds reached
if (totalFunded >= tierThreshold && !hasBadge) {
  _mint(badge);
  hasTierBadge[funder][badgeId] = true;
}
```

---

## Edge Cases Tested

1. **Refund drops campaign below target** â†’ Status reverts to ONGOING
2. **Multiple tier badges for single funder** â†’ All badges burn on refund
3. **Funder with 0 Artist Tokens** â†’ Cannot refund
4. **Campaign already COMPLETED** â†’ Cannot refund
5. **Tier percentage = 0** â†’ Reverts on creation
6. **Tiers not ascending** â†’ Reverts on creation
7. **Non-registered artist** â†’ Cannot create campaign
8. **FunderSharePercent > 50%** â†’ Reverts on creation

---

## Integration Tests

The tests include full integration scenarios:
- Artist registration â†’ Campaign creation â†’ Funding â†’ Refund
- Artist registration â†’ Campaign creation â†’ Funding â†’ Revenue â†’ Claim
- Multiple funders with different tiers â†’ Weighted profit distribution

---

## Known Issues

**Note:** There's currently a dependency conflict with Hardhat 3.x and tsx loader. If you encounter compilation errors, you may need to downgrade to Hardhat 2.x or wait for the official fix.

**Workaround:**
```bash
npm install hardhat@^2.22.0 --save-dev
```

---

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to ensure all pass
2. Add gas reporter for optimization insights
3. Add coverage reporter to track code coverage
4. Consider adding integration tests with real IDRX token
5. Add stress tests for large number of funders
